We are a (largely) technology agnostic developer user group on the Isle of Wight (UK). We meet in the evening of the first Tuesday of every month for learning, networking and food!

We also maintain an online community using a [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/324200920990417/) and on [Twitter using &#35;IWDev](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IWDev&amp;src=typd)!

Previous talks, presentations and code examples can all be found in our [Repos at GitHub](https://github.com/IWDev).
