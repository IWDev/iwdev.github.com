&#35;IWDev meetups are held, for free, at [The Castle Inn, Newport](http://www.thecastleiow.co.uk/). Which might just be the Isle of Wight's oldest pub. We make use of a large private function room, in the setting of a relaxed atmosphere - with great food and great beer!

###Interested in sponsoring?###

We've got a bunch of bright people, that do cool things at work and in their own time. If you've got anything that you think might help us - we'd absolutely love to hear from you!
