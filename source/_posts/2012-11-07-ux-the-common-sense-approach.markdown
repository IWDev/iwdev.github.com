Presented last night at **IWDev #5** by **John Godwin** (of [Summit Media](http://www.summit.co.uk)).

John also included a 15 minute pen & paper exercise for the group that went down very well (there are details in the slides, above). If any of those end up online somewhere... I'll be sure to add a link to them here.
