I think it would be cool to try and encourage some friendly competition in the #IWDev community. It's a great reason to try your hand at something you don't perhaps specialise in - and in fact, might not even be remotely comfortable with! It's also a great reason to group together in small teams and collaborate, helping to spur each other on to achieve something.

So that's why we're launching our first #IWDev Competition! <!--More--> 

Take a look at these few presentation slides for more competition details!

##Entering##
To enter the competition, you just need to Fork the [IWDev website on GitHub](https://github.com/IWDev/iwdev.github.com).

You final submission must be Pushed back to GitHub, and then open a Pull Request back to the master Repository before [IWDev #6](/blog/2012/11/05/iwdev-6-the-christmas-one/).

Carl Crawley's presentation on Git will help with this process, but you can also find out more at [GitHub Training](http://training.github.com/).

##Octopress##
The website is built using [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It is a static website generator built in Ruby. 

Hopefully you'll be able to use the instructions on the Octopress website to get the IWDev website up and running - I know several members of the IWDev community (myself included) know how to get it up and running (and the documentation is pretty excellent). 

This might be where working as a Team rather than an individual might help... be sure to team up with somebody who's comfortable with it.

I'll add more help and documentation here as and when the requirement arises.
