Hello and welcome to the very first edition of IWDev Monthly. We hope to deliever you these posts every month so that you catch up on the things you might have missed since the last meeting. We planning on showcasing projects that our community is working, updates on upcoming events and general news in case you've been living under a rock for the last month.

As you may know, next month is a big month indeed. It's our birthday month. Although, at the time of writing, we are undecided what we should do for our birthday currently; what I can promise you is a nice little surprise and possibly cakes. Everyone loves cakes.

On the games front it looks like [Lindon Heaven](https://plus.google.com/100528491356811877876/posts) is releasing another app for the iOS platform with a little game called [A Waggy Christmas Tail](http://waggychristmas.blogspot.co.uk/). It appears to be a christmas timed release, so I look forward to downloading and having a play when its out (ETA: November 15th 2013). [Gareth Williams]() on the other hand is still pursuing his one game a month (#1GAM) challenge with [RoboFight](http://www.garethpw.co.uk/2013/06/1gam-may-robofight.html). I haven't had chance to download and try it out yet, please do and give the game developers your support. I personally would like to hear more about how these games are constructed in future developer meetings.

On a more personal note, I have just started a complete rebuild of the Multi-Node Processing framework that I worked on for my dissertation. The focus on this project is making the components re-usable where possible and accepting community contributions. Once I get the initial framework in place, I tweet a link to the repository. This all came about due to talks about continuous integration from Mike and TDD from Matt. I strongly recommend that you read Matt's post about TDD [here](http://saxonmatt.co.uk/2012/11/test-driven-development-1-your-first-test.html).

What projects are you working on at the moment? Any news from your company or companies that you follow? We would like to know.

As part of helping Matt drive the community forward, I see the website as source of information for us. If there is anything that you want to see on this website, or have a bit of news that could go into the next monthly post, feel free to tweet me at @IWDev or @SBlackler.

Have a good one,
Stu
