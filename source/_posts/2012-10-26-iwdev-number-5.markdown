###Venue:###

The Castle Inn, Newport, Isle of Wight - in their `private function` room. We're getting the venue for free, so hopefully we can show our appreciation by grabbing some dinner or something. 

A big thanks to Matt Stacey for that!

###WiFi:###

Yeah... about that!

###Agenda:###

We've got Carl Crawley (of [www.madebyhippo.com](http://www.madebyhippo.com)) talking to us about Distributed Version Control Systems (or DVCS for short) - why they're awesome, and why we should all be using them; with examples using Git and Mecurial (Hg) and will be introducing us to online services like GitHub.

The second presentation lined up will have a UX focus - details to be confirmed.

**Can't wait to see you there!**
