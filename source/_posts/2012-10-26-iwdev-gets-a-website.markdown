Its probably about time! A group of tech-savvy web/software developers really had no excuse, right?

I've taken the approach of minimal effort, maximum reward. So I'm using as many cool new tools and services that I can. 

So I've installed Ruby and the Development Kit on my Windows 7 machine (using [www.rubyinstaller.org](http://www.rubyinstaller.org)). Then I've used Octopress ([www.octopress.org](http://www.octopress.org)) as the website/blog - which is source controlled at GitHub ([www.github.com](http://www.github.com)) and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages ([pages.github.com](http://pages.github.com)). Finally I installed a pretty nice theme made by Geeks of London ([www.geeksoflondon.com](http://geeksoflondon.com)). 

All free. All cool. Learned a few bits along the way and exposed me to some technology I was otherwise ignorant to.

If you fancy setting up a personal blog, give it a try.
