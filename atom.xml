    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the very first edition of IWDev Monthly. We hope to deliever you these posts every month so that you catch up on the things you might have missed since the last meeting. We planning on showcasing projects that our community is working, updates on upcoming events and general news in case you&#8217;ve been living under a rock for the last month.</p>

<p>As you may know, next month is a big month indeed. It&#8217;s our birthday month. Although, at the time of writing, we are undecided what we should do for our birthday currently; what I can promise you is a nice little surprise and possibly cakes. Everyone loves cakes.</p>

<p>On the games front it looks like <a href="https://plus.google.com/100528491356811877876/posts">Lindon Heaven</a> is releasing another app for the iOS platform with a little game called <a href="http://waggychristmas.blogspot.co.uk/">A Waggy Christmas Tail</a>. It appears to be a christmas timed release, so I look forward to downloading and having a play when its out (ETA: November 15th 2013). <a href="">Gareth Williams</a> on the other hand is still pursuing his one game a month (#1GAM) challenge with <a href="http://www.garethpw.co.uk/2013/06/1gam-may-robofight.html">RoboFight</a>. I haven&#8217;t had chance to download and try it out yet, please do and give the game developers your support. I personally would like to hear more about how these games are constructed in future developer meetings.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I have just started a complete rebuild of the Multi-Node Processing framework that I worked on for my dissertation. The focus on this project is making the components re-usable where possible and accepting community contributions. Once I get the initial framework in place, I tweet a link to the repository. This all came about due to talks about continuous integration from Mike and TDD from Matt. I strongly recommend that you read Matt&#8217;s post about TDD <a href="http://saxonmatt.co.uk/2012/11/test-driven-development-1-your-first-test.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>What projects are you working on at the moment? Any news from your company or companies that you follow? We would like to know.</p>

<p>As part of helping Matt drive the community forward, I see the website as source of information for us. If there is anything that you want to see on this website, or have a bit of news that could go into the next monthly post, feel free to tweet me at @IWDev or @SBlackler.</p>

<p>Have a good one,
Stu</p>

    <updated>2012-11-07T12:57:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://iwdev.github.com/blog/2012/11/07/website-competition-help</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m quite aware that the competition has several potential knowledge barriers. I am hoping that in participating will help in learning and installing a few different things (learning is fun, right?) - but I understand that time isn&#8217;t cheap and we don&#8217;t all have much of it. So I&#8217;ve put together a little step-by-step how-to to help you on your way. In honesty I&#8217;ve only tested this process on Windows 7 - but I think that it is pretty sound.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>1. Pre-requisites</h3>

<p><strong>Ruby 1.9.3 Runtime and Development Environment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/rbenv/">Rbenv</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/rvm/">RVM</a>, or</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re on Windows it is easier to use <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a> with <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit">The Ruby DevKit</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Get the IWDev Website from GitHub</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to <code>https://github.com/IWDev</code> in your favourite browser.</li>
<li>Click on the <code>iwdev.github.com</code> repository in the list.</li>
<li>Click on the <code>Fork</code> button at the top right - this will copy the entire IWDev website repository to your very own private version of the website.</li>
<li>Clone your version of the IWDev website down to a local working folder on your computer:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/&gt;your_github_username&lt;/iwdev.github.com.git IWDev-Website</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Go into the local working folder:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd IWDev-Website/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Double check which version of Ruby you have installed (and double check that it is on your path!) - it should report 1.9.3:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ruby --version</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Install the Bundler Ruby gem:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install bundler</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Run the bundler install task:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>bundle install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Generate the website from the source code:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Confirm that it has all worked, running the self-hosting preview server:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake preview</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Preview the generated website in your favourite browser at <code>http://localhost:4000/</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>3. Working with Octopress</h3>

<p>Assuming that you&#8217;re on the <code>source</code> branch of the repo, there is a <code>source/</code> directory in the root of working folder. In there is everything that you really need to edit: css, javascript, html, includes etc.</p>

<p>Here is a list of useful links to also help you on your way:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/">Theming &amp; Customization</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">Editing Content (Blog Posts &amp; Pages)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd Party Themes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins">3rd Party Plugins</a></li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230;and when you&#8217;ve made changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate the website from the source code:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Confirm that it has all worked, running the self-hosting preview server:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake preview</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>John also included a 15 minute pen &amp; paper exercise for the group that went down very well (there are details in the slides, above). If any of those end up online somewhere&#8230; I&#8217;ll be sure to add a link to them here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be cool to try and encourage some friendly competition in the #IWDev community. It&#8217;s a great reason to try your hand at something you don&#8217;t perhaps specialise in - and in fact, might not even be remotely comfortable with! It&#8217;s also a great reason to group together in small teams and collaborate, helping to spur each other on to achieve something.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re launching our first #IWDev Competition! <!--More--></p>

<p>Take a look at these few presentation slides for more competition details!</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="509947366f8e720002031886" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="http://iwdev.github.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>




<br /><br />


<h2>Entering</h2>

<p>To enter the competition, you just need to Fork the <a href="https://github.com/IWDev/iwdev.github.com">IWDev website on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You final submission must be Pushed back to GitHub, and then open a Pull Request back to the master Repository before <a href="http://iwdev.github.com/blog/2012/11/05/iwdev-6-the-christmas-one/">IWDev #6</a>.</p>

<p>Carl Crawley&#8217;s presentation on Git will help with this process, but you can also find out more at <a href="http://training.github.com/">GitHub Training</a>.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>The website is built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. It is a static website generator built in Ruby.</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to use the instructions on the Octopress website to get the IWDev website up and running - I know several members of the IWDev community (myself included) know how to get it up and running (and the documentation is pretty excellent).</p>

<p>This might be where working as a Team rather than an individual might help&#8230; be sure to team up with somebody who&#8217;s comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll add more help and documentation here as and when the requirement arises.</p>

<p>19:30 - Tuesday 4th December</p>

<h3>Venue:</h3>

<p>The Castle Inn, Newport, Isle of Wight - in their <code>private function</code> room. We&#8217;re getting the venue for free, so hopefully we can show our appreciation by grabbing some dinner or something.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Matt Stacey for that!</p>

<h3>WiFi:</h3>

<p>Yeah&#8230; about that!</p>

<h3>Agenda:</h3>

<h4>Chistmas!</h4>

<p>It&#8217;ll be less than a month until Christmas, and #IWDev 7 won&#8217;t be until 2013. Let&#8217;s have a little celebration!</p>

<h4>Session One - The Ruby Way</h4>

<p>Our Brian Prior is going to give an introduction to the Ruby programming language, using examples of how to understand and leverage the concepts that the language brings to the table.</p>

<h4>Session Two - The Cloud (think of the poor bunnies)</h4>

<p>Something of an &#8220;experimental&#8221; session that will take the form of a &#8220;group&#8221; discussion (which will hopefully lead to more detail presentations in 2013). The topic of the discussion is &#8220;the cloud&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this buzz word? What is the cloud?</li>
<li>Differences between Software as a Service (Saas) and Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</li>
<li>What benefits are there? (scalability, elasticity and redundancy)</li>
<li>What drawbacks are there? (<em>potentially</em> high costs, data ownership, legal issues and compliance)</li>
<li>When should you use the cloud?</li>
<li>When should you not use the cloud?</li>
<li>Hybrid architectures? (cloud + data centre)</li>
<li>How can we design software to live in the cloud in a way we can leverage it&#8217;s power?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/170805436391885/">register for the event on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>The second presentation lined up will have a UX focus - details to be confirmed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its probably about time! A group of tech-savvy web/software developers really had no excuse, right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken the approach of minimal effort, maximum reward. So I&#8217;m using as many cool new tools and services that I can.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve installed Ruby and the Development Kit on my Windows 7 machine (using <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">www.rubyinstaller.org</a>). Then I&#8217;ve used Octopress (<a href="http://www.octopress.org">www.octopress.org</a>) as the website/blog - which is source controlled at GitHub (<a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a>) and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages (<a href="http://pages.github.com">pages.github.com</a>). Finally I installed a pretty nice theme made by Geeks of London (<a href="http://geeksoflondon.com">www.geeksoflondon.com</a>).</p>

<p>All free. All cool. Learned a few bits along the way and exposed me to some technology I was otherwise ignorant to.</p>

<p>If you fancy setting up a personal blog, give it a try.</p>
