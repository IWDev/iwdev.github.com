<p>John also included a 15 minute pen &amp; paper exercise for the group that went down very well (there are details in the slides, above). If any of those end up online somewhere&#8230; I&#8217;ll be sure to add a link to them here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be cool to try and encourage some friendly competition in the #IWDev community. It&#8217;s a great reason to try your hand at something you don&#8217;t perhaps specialise in - and in fact, might not even be remotely comfortable with! It&#8217;s also a great reason to group together in small teams and collaborate, helping to spur each other on to achieve something.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re launching our first #IWDev Competition! <!--More--></p>

<p>Take a look at these few presentation slides for more competition details!</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="509947366f8e720002031886" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="http://iwdev.github.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>




<br /><br />


<h2>Entering</h2>

<p>To enter the competition, you just need to Fork the <a href="https://github.com/IWDev/iwdev.github.com">IWDev website on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You final submission must be Pushed back to GitHub, and then open a Pull Request back to the master Repository before <a href="http://iwdev.github.com/blog/2012/11/05/iwdev-6-the-christmas-one/">IWDev #6</a>.</p>

<p>Carl Crawley&#8217;s presentation on Git will help with this process, but you can also find out more at <a href="http://training.github.com/">GitHub Training</a>.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>The website is built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. It is a static website generator built in Ruby.</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to use the instructions on the Octopress website to get the IWDev website up and running - I know several members of the IWDev community (myself included) know how to get it up and running (and the documentation is pretty excellent).</p>

<p>This might be where working as a Team rather than an individual might help&#8230; be sure to team up with somebody who&#8217;s comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll add more help and documentation here as and when the requirement arises.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>When:</h3>

<p>19:30 - Tuesday 4th December</p>

<h3>Venue:</h3>

<p>The Castle Inn, Newport, Isle of Wight - in their <code>private function</code> room. We&#8217;re getting the venue for free, so hopefully we can show our appreciation by grabbing some dinner or something.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Matt Stacey for that!</p>

<h3>WiFi:</h3>

<p>Yeah&#8230; about that!</p>

<h3>Agenda:</h3>

<h4>Chistmas!</h4>

<p>It&#8217;ll be less than a month until Christmas, and #IWDev 7 won&#8217;t be until 2013. Let&#8217;s have a little celebration!</p>

<h4>Session One - The Ruby Way</h4>

<p>Our Brian Prior is going to give an introduction to the Ruby programming language, using examples of how to understand and leverage the concepts that the language brings to the table.</p>

<h4>Session Two - The Cloud (think of the poor bunnies)</h4>

<p>Something of an &#8220;experimental&#8221; session that will take the form of a &#8220;group&#8221; discussion (which will hopefully lead to more detail presentations in 2013). The topic of the discussion is &#8220;the cloud&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this buzz word? What is the cloud?</li>
<li>Differences between Software as a Service (Saas) and Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</li>
<li>What benefits are there? (scalability, elasticity and redundancy)</li>
<li>What drawbacks are there? (<em>potentially</em> high costs, data ownership, legal issues and compliance)</li>
<li>When should you use the cloud?</li>
<li>When should you not use the cloud?</li>
<li>Hybrid architectures? (cloud + data centre)</li>
<li>How can we design software to live in the cloud in a way we can leverage it&#8217;s power?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve got Carl Crawley (of <a href="http://www.madebyhippo.com">www.madebyhippo.com</a>) talking to us about Distributed Version Control Systems (or DVCS for short) - why they&#8217;re awesome, and why we should all be using them; with examples using Git and Mecurial (Hg) and will be introducing us to online services like GitHub.</p>

<p>The second presentation lined up will have a UX focus - details to be confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Can&#8217;t wait to see you there!</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its probably about time! A group of tech-savvy web/software developers really had no excuse, right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken the approach of minimal effort, maximum reward. So I&#8217;m using as many cool new tools and services that I can.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve installed Ruby and the Development Kit on my Windows 7 machine (using <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">www.rubyinstaller.org</a>). Then I&#8217;ve used Octopress (<a href="http://www.octopress.org">www.octopress.org</a>) as the website/blog - which is source controlled at GitHub (<a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a>) and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages (<a href="http://pages.github.com">pages.github.com</a>). Finally I installed a pretty nice theme made by Geeks of London (<a href="http://geeksoflondon.com">www.geeksoflondon.com</a>).</p>

<p>All free. All cool. Learned a few bits along the way and exposed me to some technology I was otherwise ignorant to.</p>

<p>If you fancy setting up a personal blog, give it a try.</p>
