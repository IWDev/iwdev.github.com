    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the very first edition of IWDev Monthly. We hope to deliever you these posts every month so that you catch up on the things you might have missed since the last meeting. We planning on showcasing projects that our community is working, updates on upcoming events and general news in case you&#8217;ve been living under a rock for the last month.</p>

<p>As you may know, next month is a big month indeed. It&#8217;s our birthday month. Although, at the time of writing, we are undecided what we should do for our birthday currently; what I can promise you is a nice little surprise and possibly cakes. Everyone loves cakes.</p>

<p>On the games front it looks like <a href="https://plus.google.com/100528491356811877876/posts">Lindon Heaven</a> is releasing another app for the iOS platform with a little game called <a href="http://waggychristmas.blogspot.co.uk/">A Waggy Christmas Tail</a>. It appears to be a christmas timed release, so I look forward to downloading and having a play when its out (ETA: November 15th 2013). <a href="">Gareth Williams</a> on the other hand is still pursuing his one game a month (#1GAM) challenge with <a href="http://www.garethpw.co.uk/2013/06/1gam-may-robofight.html">RoboFight</a>. I haven&#8217;t had chance to download and try it out yet, please do and give the game developers your support. I personally would like to hear more about how these games are constructed in future developer meetings.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I have just started a complete rebuild of the Multi-Node Processing framework that I worked on for my dissertation. The focus on this project is making the components re-usable where possible and accepting community contributions. Once I get the initial framework in place, I tweet a link to the repository. This all came about due to talks about continuous integration from Mike and TDD from Matt. I strongly recommend that you read Matt&#8217;s post about TDD <a href="http://saxonmatt.co.uk/2012/11/test-driven-development-1-your-first-test.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>What projects are you working on at the moment? Any news from your company or companies that you follow? We would like to know.</p>

<p>As part of helping Matt drive the community forward, I see the website as source of information for us. If there is anything that you want to see on this website, or have a bit of news that could go into the next monthly post, feel free to tweet me at @IWDev or @SBlackler.</p>

<p>Have a good one,
Stu</p>

<p>John also included a 15 minute pen &amp; paper exercise for the group that went down very well (there are details in the slides, above). If any of those end up online somewhere&#8230; I&#8217;ll be sure to add a link to them here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>When:</h3>

<p>19:30 - Tuesday 4th December</p>

<h3>Venue:</h3>

<p>The Castle Inn, Newport, Isle of Wight - in their <code>private function</code> room. We&#8217;re getting the venue for free, so hopefully we can show our appreciation by grabbing some dinner or something.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Matt Stacey for that!</p>

<h3>WiFi:</h3>

<p>Yeah&#8230; about that!</p>

<h3>Agenda:</h3>

<h4>Chistmas!</h4>

<p>It&#8217;ll be less than a month until Christmas, and #IWDev 7 won&#8217;t be until 2013. Let&#8217;s have a little celebration!</p>

<h4>Session One - The Ruby Way</h4>

<p>Our Brian Prior is going to give an introduction to the Ruby programming language, using examples of how to understand and leverage the concepts that the language brings to the table.</p>

<h4>Session Two - The Cloud (think of the poor bunnies)</h4>

<p>Something of an &#8220;experimental&#8221; session that will take the form of a &#8220;group&#8221; discussion (which will hopefully lead to more detail presentations in 2013). The topic of the discussion is &#8220;the cloud&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this buzz word? What is the cloud?</li>
<li>Differences between Software as a Service (Saas) and Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</li>
<li>What benefits are there? (scalability, elasticity and redundancy)</li>
<li>What drawbacks are there? (<em>potentially</em> high costs, data ownership, legal issues and compliance)</li>
<li>When should you use the cloud?</li>
<li>When should you not use the cloud?</li>
<li>Hybrid architectures? (cloud + data centre)</li>
<li>How can we design software to live in the cloud in a way we can leverage it&#8217;s power?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/170805436391885/">register for the event on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>The second presentation lined up will have a UX focus - details to be confirmed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its probably about time! A group of tech-savvy web/software developers really had no excuse, right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken the approach of minimal effort, maximum reward. So I&#8217;m using as many cool new tools and services that I can.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve installed Ruby and the Development Kit on my Windows 7 machine (using <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">www.rubyinstaller.org</a>). Then I&#8217;ve used Octopress (<a href="http://www.octopress.org">www.octopress.org</a>) as the website/blog - which is source controlled at GitHub (<a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a>) and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages (<a href="http://pages.github.com">pages.github.com</a>). Finally I installed a pretty nice theme made by Geeks of London (<a href="http://geeksoflondon.com">www.geeksoflondon.com</a>).</p>

<p>All free. All cool. Learned a few bits along the way and exposed me to some technology I was otherwise ignorant to.</p>

<p>If you fancy setting up a personal blog, give it a try.</p>
